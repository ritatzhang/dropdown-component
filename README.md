# Using the dropdown component

- see App.js for an example [vegetables are multi-select, fruits are single-select]
- the Dropdown components requires 3 parameters/props: boolean for multi-select, the title of the dropdown, and an array of items.
- header, width of dropdown, and most other adjustments are customizable using classnames defined in the Dropdown class

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the example in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Notes

- with more time, I think it would be nice to add a search bar option to the dropdown menu, for long lists of items
- just want to note, unfortunately I am currently travelling and will be travelling for an extended amount of time so I was only able to dedicate a handful of hours to this task. I hope this can be taken into consideration since I was not able to create the most visually appealing dropdown menu in the world (although, I am quite pleased with the functionality. I am, frankly, always a little surprised when something I write works.)
